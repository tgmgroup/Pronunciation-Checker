# Pronunciation-Checker
A TTS and STT tool for students to check their reading of specified text (pronunciation). 

This is a simple in-browser tool that can help students check their pronunciation accuracy. It's built to emulate the basic features of Microsoft's excellent [Reading Coach](https://coach.microsoft.com "Reading Coach") (but without the time and money and required login that they have). The *New Horizon* textbooks in Japan also have a similar tool, for example, this [pronunciation checker](https://sw101.tsho.jp/nh-pronunciation-/index.html?g=1&ks=41).

To use this tool, open the site and input your desired text. To pre-seed the text (especially for teachers wanting students to practice specific phrases), you can use a ?query: [https://speech.isesaki.in/index.html?text=Let's practice this text.](https://speech.isesaki.in/index.html?text=Let%27s%20practice%20this%20text.) 

This tool seems to work well in Chrome-based browsers. **Microsoft Edge** users will have access to the excellent AI-powered Native voices, of which **Andrew** and **Ava** are really nice voices to use.
